The containers *do not* share the network with the host. Instead, they join a
network provided by Docker. Each container gets its own IP address in the Docker
network. Docker may then forward some of the ports in the network to the host.

The containers also *do not* share the list of processes with the host.

The containers share the physical disk although via a virtual overlay filesystem
managed by Docker. On my system, this overlay seems to have more disk space than
the actual physical drive. A cursory investigation reveals that this is an
intentional part of the Docker emulation due to conservative assumptions: it is
easier to scale back than to scale up, so the default overlay size is set to
100G. The overlay filesystem size is the same for both containers.

The uptime (/proc/uptime) is shared to the second between host and containers.
That is curious, as that implies that perhaps some other features of the host
are shared as well. This implies that the container abstraction is by no means a
perfect virtualization, and that the container can sometimes retrieve
information from the host, even if it may be something relatively benign such as
uptime.
