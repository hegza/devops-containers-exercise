The containers *do not* share the network with the host. Instead, they join a
network provided by Docker. Each container gets its own IP address in the Docker
network. Docker may then forward some of the ports in the network to the host.

The containers also *do not* share the list of processes with the host.

The containers share the physical disk although via a virtual overlay filesystem
managed by Docker. The overlay filesystem size is the same for both containers.

The uptime (/proc/uptime) is shared between host and containers. That is
curious, as that implies that perhaps some other features of the host are shared
as well. This implies that the container abstraction is by no means a perfect
virtualization, and that the container can sometimes retrieve information from
the host, even if it may be something relatively benign such as uptime.
